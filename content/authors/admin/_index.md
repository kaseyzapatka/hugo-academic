Kasey Zapatka is a postdoctoral scholar in the sociology department at the UC Berkeley and the Urban Displacement Project at the Institute of Governmental Studies. I use quantitative methods to study urban and spatial inequality, housing affordability, neighborhood change, gentrification, suburbanization, segregation, and education inequality.
